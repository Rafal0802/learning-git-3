			<p>I would tell you about the things 
				They put me through 
				The pain I've been subjected to 
				But the Lord himself would blush 
				The countless feasts laid at my feet 
				Forbidden fruits for me to eat 
				But I think your pulse would start to rush
			</p>
			<p>Now I'm not looking for absolution 
				Forgiveness for the things I do 
				But before you come to any conclusions 
				Try walking in my shoes 
				Try walking in my shoes 	
			</p>	
			<p>You'll stumble in my footsteps 
				Keep the same appointments I kept 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
			</p>
			<p>Morality would frown upon 
				Decency look down upon 
				The scapegoat fate's made of me 
				But I promise now, my judge and jurors 
				My intentions couldn't have been purer 
				My case is easy to see 
			</p>
			<p>I'm not looking for a clearer conscience 
				Peace of mind after what I've been through 
				And before we talk of any repentance 
				Try walking in my shoes 
				Try walking in my shoes 
			</p>
			<p>You'll stumble in my footsteps 
				Keep the same appointments I kept 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
				Try walking in my shoes
			</p>
			<p>Now I'm not looking for absolution 
				Forgiveness for the things I do 
				But before you come to any conclusions 
				Try walking in my shoes 
				Try walking in my shoes 
			</p>
			<p>You'll stumble in my footsteps 
				Keep the same appointments I kept 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
			</p>
			<p>You'll stumble in my footsteps 
				Keep the same appointments I kept 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
				Try walking in my shoes 
				If you try walking in my shoes 
				Try walking in my shoes
